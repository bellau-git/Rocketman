                our working practices accordingly so that our employees be as much 
                comfortable as possible. We have hybrid working environment, meaning 
                that you can work from home as well as from the Redberry Sairme office. 
                But we would love you to see in the office because we belive that face to 
                face communications are much more fun and productive than zoom meetings. </p>

                what‚Äôs new in Laravel 9 and so on. This kind of devtalks are attended in Office but also broadcasted 
                 through Zoom meetings. So you are feel free to join in any way possible. Join Us!</p>
